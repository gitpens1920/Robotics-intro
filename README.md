# Robotics-intro
Introduction to setting up and working through simple Gazebo and ROS based simulations

# Installation

System - Ubuntu 24.04, plenty of RAM and VRAM.

Assumption 1: network speed is at least 100Mbps.

[X] Setup separate python environment

- not required as ROS will take care of this... 

[X] install ROS, takes ~10 minutes (assuming connection speeds of at least 100Mbps)

- https://docs.ros.org/en/kilted/Installation.html, selected kilt as it was the latest release.

- https://docs.ros.org/en/kilted/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html
  
- - For Desktop install only the below line is required. The base packages are installed with it (the bare bones...
    
        sudo apt install ros-kilted-desktop

[X] install Gazebo, takes ~5 minutes

ROS Projects

- Isaac ROS Nvblox : Hardware-accelerated 3D scene reconstruction and Nav2 local costmap provider using nvblox.
- Isaac ROS Object Detection : Deep learning model support for object detection including DetectNet
- Isaac ROS DNN Inference : This repository provides two NVIDIA GPU-accelerated ROS 2 nodes that perform deep learning inference using custom models. One node uses the TensorRT SDK, while the other uses the Triton SDK.
- Isaac ROS Visual SLAM : This repository provides a ROS 2 package that estimates stereo visual inertial odometry using the Isaac Elbrus GPU-accelerated library.
- Isaac ROS Argus Camera : This repository provides monocular and stereo nodes that enable ROS developers to use cameras connected to Jetson platforms over a CSI interface.
- Isaac ROS image_pipeline : This metapackage offers similar functionality as the standard, CPU-based image_pipeline metapackage, but does so by leveraging the Jetson platformâ€™s specialized computer vision hardware.
- Isaac ROS Common : Isaac ROS common utilities for use in conjunction with the Isaac ROS suite of packages.
- Isaac ROS AprilTags : ROS 2 node uses the NVIDIA GPU-accelerated AprilTags library to detect AprilTags in images and publish their poses, ids, and additional metadata.
- ROS and ROS 2 Docker Images : Docker images for easy deployment on the NVIDIA Jetson platform, consisting of ROS 2, PyTorch, and other important machine learning libraries.
- ROS and ROS 2 DockerFiles: Dockerfiles for ROS 2 based on l4t which all you to build your own Docker image.
